// tests Entity-Environment-Effect processing by the Qubic Dispatcher

// note that it is common sense to create specific functions when you
// want to use them in combination with environments and have them wrap
// the more generic, reusable functions. This keeps the generic functions
// 'clean' and also will allow you to have a more specific structured trit
// vector as input that provides more info you can filter on, like an
// invocation id which would allow you to discern between return values
// from a shared environment so that you only process results that were
// intended for you


// note that we have two environments: 'first' and 'second'

// this function will be called from the top level
// it affects environment 'first', which means that its result
// will be posted as an affect to that environment
func Int firstOne (Int val) {
  affect first
  return val
}

// this function joins environment 'first', which means it will get sent
// the effects posted to this environment by firstOne() in the next wave
// it also affects environment 'second', which means that its result
// will be posted as an affect to that environment
func Int nextOne (Int val) {
  join first
  affect second
  return fibonacci2<Int>(val)
}

// finally, this function joins environment 'second',  which means it will get sent
// the effects posted to this environment by nextOne() in the next wave
// since it does not affect any environments processing will stop after this wave
func Int lastOne (Int val) {
  join second
